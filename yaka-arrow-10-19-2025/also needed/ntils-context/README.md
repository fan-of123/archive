# ntils:context
Context is a module for context access. "Access" means turning things like: execution position, rotation, dimension, etc into usable values. This module might seem nonworthwhile, but it is both convenient and performant (notably, the `vec` function is particularly efficient). Check the included functions to see what accessors exist.

I might expand this to include context manipulation as well, but haven't gotten around to it.
