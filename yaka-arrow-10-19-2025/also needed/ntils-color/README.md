# ntils:color
Color is a module for working with colors. Currently, this only contains several functions for gradients and an HSL -> RGB color conversion. HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness, and I put this function in because doing color gradients in HSL and then converting to RGB makes for much nicer effects than just doing the gradients in RGB.

This might be expanded at some point, but for the moment it's pretty barebones.
